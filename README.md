### Fork and bundle
- Fork the project
- Run bundle to install gems
```bash

```

### Create your GitHub application

Unless you only want to edit the homepage, you'll need your own GitHub credentials for development.
 
Go to your settings, than [OAuth applications](https://github.com/settings/developers) and register a new application.

For `Authorization callback URL` field, use: http://localhost:3000/users/auth/github/callback. The other fields (name, description) may be filled at your will.

### Configure your environment

Copy the file `.env.example` to `.env` and fill the fields

```bash
DB_USERNAME=
DB_PASSWORD=

APP_DOMAIN=localhost

GITHUB_KEY=
GITHUB_SECRET=
```

If you're using Linux or OSX, you probably don't need to fill the `DB_` fields

### Database setup

### Redis setup

Redis is used for managing queues inside the application.

For more information about how to install Redis, please refer to [https://redis.io/topics/quickstart](https://redis.io/topics/quickstart)

### Running Tests

```bash
bundle exec rspec
```

### Running Server

## Road map

We have a road map of what we are going to implement next. It is available at our projects page

[https://github.com/gitshowcase/gitshowcase/projects](https://github.com/gitshowcase/gitshowcase/projects)

If you wish to add features that are not on the road map, you're very welcome to do so. We encourage you to
[create an Issue](https://github.com/gitshowcase/gitshowcase/issues/new)
before coding, so we can all discuss the relevance to the community.

Please keep in mind that the focus is to create a great product, so we might not implement/accept all the suggested features.
